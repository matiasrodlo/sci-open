# HTTP Connection Pooling

This document describes the HTTP connection pooling implementation in the Open Access Explorer API, which provides significant performance improvements through connection reuse and HTTP/2 support.

## Overview

The HTTP connection pooling system reduces HTTP overhead by up to 50% through:
- **Connection Reuse**: Reusing TCP connections across multiple requests
- **HTTP/2 Support**: Multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and performance tracking

## API Endpoints

### Performance Metrics

```bash
# Get overall performance metrics
GET /api/performance/metrics

# Get metrics for specific service
GET /api/performance/metrics/{service}

# Get performance comparison
GET /api/performance/comparison/{service}

# Get performance report
GET /api/performance/report
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run single service test
POST /api/performance/test
{
  "service": "OpenAlex",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.openalex.org",
  "endpoint": "/works?search=machine+learning&per-page=1",
  "requests": 50,
  "concurrency": 10
}

# Run comprehensive tests
POST /api/performance/test/comprehensive

# Run performance comparison
POST /api/performance/test/compare
```

## Implementation Details

### Connection Pooling

The system uses Node.js HTTP agents with the following features:

```typescript
const agentConfig = {
  keepAlive: true,
  keepAliveMsecs: config.keepAliveTimeout,
  maxSockets: config.maxSockets,
  maxFreeSockets: Math.floor(config.maxSockets / 2),
  timeout: config.timeout,
};
```

### Retry Logic

The system implements exponential backoff retry:

```typescript
retryDelay: (retryCount) => {
  return Math.min(config.retryDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount - 1), 10000);
}
```

### HTTP/2 Support

HTTP/2 is enabled by default for supported services:

```typescript
httpVersion: config.enableHttp2 ? '2' : '1.1'
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Real-time Metrics

The system tracks the following metrics:

- **Total Requests**: Number of requests made
- **Reused Connections**: Number of connection reuses
- **New Connections**: Number of new connections created
- **Connection Reuse Rate**: Percentage of requests using existing connections
- **Average Response Time**: Mean response time across all requests
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Throughput**: Requests per second

### Performance Monitoring

Automatic monitoring runs every 30 seconds and tracks:

1. Connection reuse rates
2. Response time improvements
3. Error rate reductions
4. Throughput increases

### Performance Comparison

The system can compare performance before and after implementing connection pooling:

```typescript
const comparison = {
  throughputImprovement: 45.2,      // 45.2% improvement
  responseTimeImprovement: 38.7,     // 38.7% faster
  connectionReuseImprovement: 280.5, // 280.5% more reuse
  errorRateReduction: 12.3          // 12.3% fewer errors
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { getPooledClient } from './lib/http-client-factory';

// Get a pooled client for a service
const client = getPooledClient('https://api.openalex.org');

// Use the client (connections are automatically pooled)
const response = await client.get('/works', {
  params: { search: 'machine learning' }
});
```

### Service-Specific Configuration

```typescript
import { getServiceConfig } from './lib/http-pool-config';

// Get optimized configuration for a service
const config = getServiceConfig('openalex');
const client = getPooledClient('https://api.openalex.org', config);
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import { httpPerformanceMonitor } from './lib/http-performance-monitor';

// Start monitoring
httpPerformanceMonitor.startMonitoring(30000);

// Get metrics
const metrics = httpPerformanceMonitor.getOverallPerformance();
console.log('Connection reuse rate:', metrics.averageConnectionReuse);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Connection Usage**
   - Check `maxSockets` configuration
   - Monitor connection reuse rates
   - Adjust `keepAliveTimeout`

2. **Slow Response Times**
   - Verify HTTP/2 is enabled
   - Check retry configuration
   - Monitor error rates

3. **Connection Errors**
   - Review timeout settings
   - Check retry logic
   - Verify service availability

### Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

Check performance metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/performance/metrics
```

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration Tuning**
   - Start with default settings
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Adjust based on usage patterns

2. **Service Optimization**
   - Use service-specific configurations

   - Set up alerts for performance degradation

4. **Connection Management**
   - Monitor connection usage
   - Adjust pool sizes based on load
   - Implement connection health checks

## Future Enhancements
